# NeuralNetwork
# multi layered neural network
# can be train to predict stock prices , digit recognition (minist dataset) etc
# neural network do not have 'bias' so input cannot contain 'zero' (data should be masked such that it do not contain 'zero' as input)

# initialise neural network
    # 'inode' number of nodes in input layer / number of input
    # 'hnode' is a list containing number of nodes in each hidden layer
    # 'onode' number of nodes in output layer / number of output
    # (10, [4,5,6,3], 4, .5)
   
   

# 'train' method is used to train neural network
    # 'input_list' 1D numpy array or 1D list containing inputs
    # 'output_list' 1D numpy array or 1D list containing output/result
    


# 'query' method is used to test neural network
    # 'input_list' 1D numpy array or 1D list containing inputs
    # output of this method is 2D numpy array of size (n x 1)
